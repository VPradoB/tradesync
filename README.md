# TradeSync - Real-Time Transaction Analysis Platform

## Description
TradeSync is a specialized module for managing Stripe transactions, designed to be easily integrated into any project with minimal configuration. It features an optimized architecture based on CQRS, Event Sourcing, and the Repository Pattern with Unit of Work, ensuring efficient and auditable payment processing.

This module is ideal for developers looking for a scalable and reusable solution to handle payments without dealing with the complexity of Stripe integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis (for caching)
- **Messaging:** Kafka
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Kubernetes + Terraform
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

## Key Features
### ðŸ“¥ Transaction Processing (Command Side - CQRS)
- API for receiving and validating transactions.
- Uses **Repository Pattern + Unit of Work** for persistence.
- Event generation: `TransactionCreated`, `TransactionUpdated`, `TransactionFailed`.

### ðŸ“¤ Optimized Queries (Query Side - CQRS)
- Optimized API for searching transactions by user, date, amount, etc.
- Uses **Redis caching** for frequent queries.
- Data synchronization with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch for fast searches.

### ðŸ“œ Event Sourcing & Auditing
- All transactions generate **immutable events** in an Event Store.
- Historical events can be **replayed** for auditing or state reconstruction.
- Implementation of an **Event Bus** with RabbitMQ/Kafka.

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Dashboard (Future Feature)
- Generate statistics and detect fraudulent transactions.
- Real-time streaming with WebSockets and Grafana.
